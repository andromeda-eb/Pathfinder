# Pathfinder 09/2020
A path finding program that implements multiple algorithms: breadth-first search, depth-first search, djikstra's algorithm and A*.

# Instructions
Left-click on the grid to add a start node, end node and (optionally) a barrier node. Right-click on a node to erase. Then press one 
of the buttons at the bottom of the screen to implement an algorithm.

# Color Explanations
Green: start node, end node and shortest path
Red: node that has been searched
Blue: node that we have yet to search (neighbours of previously searched nodes)
